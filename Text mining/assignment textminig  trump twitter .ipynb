Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @ BarackObama in today\\'s debt talks--First and foremost CUT,CAP and BALANCE. THe Art of the Deal--\"The best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you have.\" CUT, CAP and BALANCE. If only @ Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel\\'s borders then America would be on the path to solvency. @johnboehner Message for House GOP \"The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.\" - The Art of the Deal. @ Obama - Iranian weapons killing Americans in Iraq? What are u doing about this?http://bit.ly/olNqW5 ObamaCare Tragedy Primed to Further Explode the Deficit http://bit.ly/q2iYtw And @ Obama transferred $500 billion from Medicare to fund it!

What is better advice- \"The Art of the Deal\" or \"Rules for Radicals\"? I know which one @ BarackObama prefers. Who will be the next @ TheRealTeenUSA? Find out this Saturday at 8PM ET on missteenusa.com # TeenUSA @ BarackObama You have increased discretionary spending by 25% annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt. T-E-Ahttp://on.wsj.com/onsY3b @ marcorubio is right. We need to create more taxpayers, not more taxes. CUT, CAP AND BALANCE.http://onforb.es/pBvGuq Congratulations to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday. # trumpvlog The Republicans must act now, don\\'t let @ barackobama push you around....http://bit.ly/nRaHB7 @ BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd Amendment rights. Every dollar @ BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren\\'s backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE! The GOP doesn\\'t waste an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal. So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk? @johnboehner @ EricCantor \"You can\\'t con people...if you don\\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.\" - The Art of the Deal While @ BarackObama seeks to further destroy our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President. http://onforb.es/cDzmaN http://onforb.es/cDzmaN Obamacare is The Biggest Tax Increase In U.S. History--repeal it as part of any deal. Check out http://onforb.es/cDzmaN Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly. Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it. \"China is our enemy--they want to destroy us\" -- Redstate Interview We could use the Balanced Budget Amendment--Politicians don\\'t have the will to cut spending. \"The Gang of Six\" - yet another unmitigated disaster. ANY DEAL NEEDS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. T-E-A. My interview on @ gretawire last night - \"Our Leaders Are Leading Us Into \\'Oblivion\\'\"http://bit.ly/oslQVM \"Increasing America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally.\" - US Senator @ BarackObama, 2007 Ronald Kessler\\'s new book \"The Secrets of the FBI\" is a great book that should be read by everyone. Unfortunately@BarackObama\\'s continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline. The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly. The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @ BarackObama.... http://bit.ly/qjI442 # trumpvlog Obama, sadly, has no business or private sector background---and it shows. Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions---cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors. My thoughts on the situation in Norway and Amanda Knox... http://bit.ly/nUTNVB # trumpvlog My interview from yesterday on Fox and Friends -- \"GOP Crazy If They Don\\'t Get Everything They Want\" http://bit.ly/nKsBBF America\\'s debt is greater than our GDP. Time for new thinking. China has so much of our debt that they can\\'t put us in default w/o killing themselves---US needs our toughest negotiator---and fast! Higher Taxes kill job creation---cut wild government spending and waste. Watch my wife Melania Trump tonight on @ QVC at 1 a.m. So proud of her! \"Know when to walk away from the table.\" The Art of the Deal People ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first time--they are never prepared or maybe just very nervous! My interview yesterday from Newsmax - \"Obama Is \\'Now Totally Lost,\\' Boehner Must Not Fold\" http://bit.ly/n7Ahdk @ KarlRove\\'s @ CrossroadsGPS new ad criticizes Obama for his excessive spending and debt, borrowing from China. Didn\\'t Bush do the same thing? Please tweet me your questions to answer in my # trumpvlog. @Johnboehner \"The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.\" --The Art of the Deal My wife Melania Trump\\'s show was a tremendous success last night. In case you missed her, you can see her again tonight on @ QVC at 7 pm ET @ BarackObama has not released his own debt plan yet. He\\'s totally lost, ineffective, desperate. GOP has its best chance to make a great deal I appreciate the kind words of Mike Huckabee, a fine American http://bit.ly/pEBsgY I just got Mike Leach\\'s new book, Swing Your Sword. He\\'s a great coach, and he\\'s written a great book. It\\'s definitely worth reading. \"Never quit and always hit back\" -- The Art of the Comeback Blue Ribbon Commission to find and agree to future spending cuts? Bad idea. If Obama has to re-fight this fight next year he loses -- \"Watch the fine details in every deal\" -- The Art of the Deal Watched Sean Hannity last night -- a great guy. No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America. We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem. Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure. Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is a mistake.

Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that. OPEC is ripping us off. If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas? If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood, then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences.

The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher. Fast and Furious put semi-automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans - @ BarackObama should answer all questions.

America is the most beautiful country on Earth. A guy named @ BobBeckel on FOX, their resident liberal, was not born with much of a brain. New study shows 80% of Congress have no business experience--it shows! The Fed\\'s reckless monetary policy is going to create record inflation.

A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector. Why did @ BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security. The Misery Index is at a 28 year high. Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy, not a friend.

Watch me tonight at 9PM ET on @ CNN, full hour. @ Piersmorgan won @ ApprenticeNBC before taking over Larry King\\'s slot- should be interesting. The Debt is our nation\\'s greatest threat. @ BarackObama is out of touch. When will our nation\\'s sacrifices be respectfully appreciated? Iraq and Libya should reimburse us in oil. Our worst threat to unemployment is @ ObamaCare. It will also destroy our country\\'s basic standards. The US Air Force won the war in Libya to clear the way for Islamic Extremist control of Libya.

Egypt\\'s Muslim Brotherhood just made its first visit to Hamas-led Gaza. Why did @ BarackObama promote the \"Arab Spring\"? The economy won\\'t fully recover until @ ObamaCare is fully repealed. It is a job killer! The greatest threat to our security is our debt. It is already past 100% GDP. We need to make real budget cuts.

This is unsustainable and a true danger. The American dream is being destroyed. Our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing. Washington does not have a revenue problem. Some @ OWS protesters are sincere people frustrated with the system--others just in for the party. America should not be pressuring @ Israel to show restraint against Iran. We should be working to stop Iran\\'s nuclear drive. Instead of trash talking @ PMIsrael on the world stage, @ BarackObama should be defending @ Israel. The @ SuperCommittee will fail.

What Hope & Change! Just as I predicted, @ BarackObama has not allowed an independent investigation into the national security leaks from his cabinet.

Smart move by the Democrats to have Pres. @ billclinton play a key role in their convention. The text of @ MittRomney\\'s speech from @ Israel http://bit.ly/MfBEPa Mitt will be a trusted friend of @ Israel when he is President. The difference between @ MittRomney and @ BarackObama\\'s campaign promises to @ Israel is that Mitt will actually keep all of his. . @ BarackObama bowed to the Saudi King in public--yet the Dems are questioning @ MittRomney\\'s diplomatic skills. . @ BarackObama should be careful questioning @ MittRomney on diplomacy--how many times has Obama apologized for our country on foreign soil?! The US GDP in 2010 was 4.1%, down to 2% in 2011 & now 1.5%. I guess @ BarackObama\\'s plan is not working! The Chinese are illegally dumping bird-killing wind turbines on our shores. Only one of many grievances--we should act. Not only does ObamaCare have at least 21 new taxes but it will lead to a tremendous doctor shortfall. Reckless-- @ BarackObama is projecting $1.2T deficit from 2012 budget & a projected $25.4T debt in a decade http://apne.ws/QLWPVi . @ BarackObama blocked Keystone.

Great to see @ MittRomney being well-received in Poland http://bit.ly/OxXKwb The Poles understand the value of freedom through strength Another example of @ BarackObama\\'s diplomatic triumphs--he gave the Queen of England an iIPod filled with his speeches.

I wonder how much money @ HuffPost lost today--great purchase AOL . @ RogerJStoneJr was great on @ TheKudlowReport last night. Roger and Larry are good friends! Amazing--both Transformers & Dark Knight Rises featured Trump properties and each grossed over $1B. Just coincidence. Every economic climate, whether an uptick or downturn, presents new opportunities and challenges. Distressed real estate opportunities can make great investments. You need the foresight and instincts to know the property\\'s true potential. Glad to hear @ BarackObama\\'s attack ad featuring my plane is playing in North Carolina. Free ad time for Trump National in Charlotte! Only three weeks until the new season of @ CelebApprentice begins filming--great all-star cast. I am tired of @ BarackObama talking about @ MittRomney\\'s father. Why don\\'t we discuss Barack Obama Sr.! It\\'s amazing how many people still come up to me to thank me for \\'The Art of The Deal.\\' The book has changed a lot of lives. Many people will be surprised at what is about to be released concerning @ BarackObama\\'s background. I, for one, won\\'t be. \"An idealist is a person who helps other people to be prosperous.\" --Henry Ford . @ washingtonpost thinks @ IvankaTrump is \"What Washington\\'s Social Scene Needs\" http://wapo.st/O5Hfq2 Truth is, she\\'s amazing. My shirts, ties and fragrance are doing \"great\" at @ Macys--try them! Make fantastic gifts. . @ BarackObama was caught telling Russian PM @ MedvedevRussiaE that he can be more \\'flexible\\' in his second term. Russia thinks he\\'s weak. Gas prices are soaring. $4.12 in CA. OPEC is laughing at how stupid we are. Putin just sent a Russian nuclear sub to the Gulf of Mexico. @ BarackObama can\\'t be bothered, he is too concerned with @ MittRomney\\'s taxes. We are about to have a record $500B trade deficit with the Chinese this year. That money should be back here financing jobs in America. Congratulations to @ Yankees Derek Jeter on passing Eddie Murray last night to become the 11th all-time @ MLB hit leader. . @ EdRendell\\'s book, \"A Nation of Wusses\" is an excellent read--especially page 10. Go get it! Can\\'t wait to meet patriotic small business owners next week in Sarasota and Tampa! Hey @ BarackObama, We Did Build It! . @ BarackObama said he doesn\\'t take the Navy Seals campaigning against him \"too seriously.\" It\\'s Wednesday. I wonder how much money @ BarackObama borrowed from China today? Here\\'s a sneak peek at the @ DNC convention theme: \"It\\'s not our fault. Blame Bush. Oh, and government built it.\" \"Change is not a destination, just as hope is not a strategy.\" -- Rudy Giuliani One of the best moves I made early in my career was buying the air rights from Tiffany\\'s flagship. Trump Tower gleams over Fifth Avenue. It\\'s sad to see once decent newspapers like @ USAToday failing so badly. I just don\\'t know if they can be saved.'"
